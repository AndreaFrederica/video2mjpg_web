2. License Grants and Conditions
--------------------------------

2.1. Grants

Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive license:
(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, modify, display,
    perform, sublicense and distribute the Covered Software made by such
    Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis,
    with Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and
(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor that are necessarily
    infringed by the Covered Software or any Derivative Work thereof,
    to make, use, sell, sell for import, have made, and have imported
    only to the extent necessary to exercise obligations under Section
    2.2. If You institute patent litigation against any entity
    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
    the Covered Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent,
    then the patent licenses granted to You under Section 2.1(b) shall
    terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

2.2. Effective Date

The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Covered
Software become effective as of the date such Covered Software is first
distributed under the terms of this License unless a different date is
specified in the notice in Exhibit A of the Covered Software.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b), in no event are any patent claims of a
Contributor enforceable against You solely based on your incorporation,
combination, or use of Covered Software with other software or hardware.

2.4. Conditions

You may not distribute the Covered Software or Modifications under any
license except under the terms of this License or such Secondary Licenses
as are permitted under Section 1.4. All distribution of the Covered
Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create
or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License and
You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered
Software is governed by the terms of this License, and You must include
a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code Form. You may
not offer or impose any terms that alter or restrict the applicable
version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder.

However, You may include an additional document offering the additional
rights described in Section 3.7.

2.5. No Trademark

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

3. Distribution Obligations
----------------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
the terms of this License and You must inform recipients that the Source
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
License, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of
the Source Code Form. You may not offer or impose any terms that alter
or restrict the applicable version of this License or the recipients'
rights hereunder.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
License permits You to additionally distribute Covered Software under the
terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the use of the Covered
Software is not restricted by this License.

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or
limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the
Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the
extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your
own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other
Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each
Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted
against, such Contributor by reason of Your accepting any such warranty,
support, indemnity or liability obligation or right.

3.6. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
the terms of this License and You must inform recipients that the Source
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
License, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of
the Source Code Form. You may not offer or impose any terms that alter
or restrict the applicable version of this License or the recipients'
rights hereunder.

3.7. Additional Terms

Notwithstanding the limitations in Section 2.1, You may distribute
Covered Software in Executable Form only under the terms of this License
and under a Secondary License that adequately covers the Covered
Software, unless doing so would cause the Covered Software to be
Incompatible With Secondary Licenses.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
----------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation, then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file that is included with all distributions of the
Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by
statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for
a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination
--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your rights, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if the Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your rights under this License from
a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such
Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means,
this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance from
such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your
receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions or
counter-claims or cross-claims) arising from or pertaining to Covered
Software, then the patent licenses granted to You by such Contributor to
the Covered Software shall terminate as of the date such litigation is
filed.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty
-------------------------

Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as-is" basis,
without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory,
including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is
free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or
non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the
Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective
in any respect, You assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of
this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this
License except under this disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability
--------------------------

Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort
(including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by
applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) shall any
Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect,
special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as
a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Covered Software (including but not limited to damages for loss of
goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been
advised of the possibility of such damages.

8. Litigation
-------------

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts
of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of
business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
jurisdiction, without reference to its conflicts-of-law provisions.
Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous
----------------

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

10. Versions of the License

Mozilla Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the License
from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version
number.
